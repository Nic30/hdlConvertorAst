#Note

All files in this folder (recursively) are used as a test reference data or test data.
They are not executed. In order to execute them you need a different tool (SV/VHDL/C++ compiler)
or you need to install additional libraries.

Note that this test-case is best-effort solution for testing of this library and it's purpose
is to early detect errors in this library but the real test case is in [hdlConvertor](https://github.com/Nic30/hdlConvertor)
(parser library) and in [hwtLib](https://github.com/Nic30/hwtLib) (library of HDL components).
